### overview

Bots on the SnatchBot platform can be used with nearly any communication channel, such as text, voice and e-mail; messaging tools such as Facebook, Skype, Slack and Snatchbot’s own enterprise-grade messaging platform called [SnatchApp](https://snatchapp.me/); and within a company website or mobile app.

In other words, SnatchBot allows you to build true [omnichannel](https://snatchbot.me/channels) bots with just a single bot configuration.
